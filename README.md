# pong_zx
ZX Spectrum assembly showing the framework for a basic pong game.

there is no collision detection, but that should be fairly easy for anyone else to include e.g 
IF ballX = playerX and ballY = playerY = we have a collision, so the ball reverses (neg ix+5 and ix+6) 

you do the same with the enemy paddle. 

I have the ball bouncing around the screen but obviously if it goes off the edge of Y then its a
point to the other player. 

Anyway its all very rough and ready and cobbled together quickly just to show an example. Don't 
bug me about it!
